# InputOutputFile

The purpose of this short program is to demonstrate how to read and write to files in C++;

This basic program will open a .txt file and read the contents of first 3 lines.  The expected format is

```
first name
last name
amount of money in wallet
```

Once the file is read, the `amount of money in wallet` will be converted to a `double`.  From there a .out file will be created and the three variables will be written into that file.
